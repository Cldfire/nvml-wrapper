Struct that represents a unit.

Obtain a `Unit` with the various methods available to you on the `NVML`
struct.

Lifetimes are used to enforce that each `Unit` instance cannot be used after
the `NVML` instance it was obtained from is dropped:

```compile_fail
use nvml_wrapper::NVML;
# use nvml_wrapper::error::*;

# fn main() -> Result<(), NvmlError> {
let nvml = NVML::init()?;
let unit = nvml.unit_by_index(0)?;

drop(nvml);

// This won't compile
let unit_devices = unit.devices()?;
# Ok(())
# }
```

Note that I cannot test any `Unit` methods myself as I do not have access to
such hardware. **Test the functionality in this module before you use it**.
