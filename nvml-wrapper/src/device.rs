    If you pass `None` as `pci_info`, `.pci_info()` will be called in order to obtain

    This call only works if no other processes are attached. If other processes
    are attached when this is called, the `InUse` error will be returned and
    this `Device` will return to its original draining state. The only situation
    where this can occur is if a process was and is still using this `Device`
    before the call to `set_drain()` was made and it was enabled. Note that
    persistence mode counts as an attachment to this `Device` and thus must be
    disabled prior to this call.

    For long-running NVML processes, please note that this will change the
    enumeration of current GPUs. As an example, if there are four GPUs present
    and the first is removed, the new enumeration will be 0-2. Device handles
    for the removed GPU will be invalid.

    NVIDIA doesn't provide much documentation about the `gpu_state` and `link_state`
    parameters, so you're on your own there. It does say that the `gpu_state`
    controls whether or not this `Device` should be removed from the kernel.

    Must be run as administrator.

    # Bad Ergonomics Explanation

    Previously the design of `error-chain` made it impossible to return stuff

    `std::error::Error`, so this situation no longer needs to be, but I haven't
    made time to re-work it.
