/*!
A safe and ergonomic Rust wrapper for the [NVIDIA Management Library][nvml] (NVML),
a C-based programmatic interface for monitoring and managing various states within
NVIDIA GPUs.

```
use nvml_wrapper::Nvml;
# use nvml_wrapper::error::*;
# fn test() -> Result<(), NvmlError> {

let nvml = Nvml::init()?;
// Get the first `Device` (GPU) in the system
let device = nvml.device_by_index(0)?;

let brand = device.brand()?; // GeForce on my system
let fan_speed = device.fan_speed(0)?; // Currently 17% on my system
let power_limit = device.enforced_power_limit()?; // 275k milliwatts on my system
let encoder_util = device.encoder_utilization()?; // Currently 0 on my system; Not encoding anything
let memory_info = device.memory_info()?; // Currently 1.63/6.37 GB used on my system

// ... and there's a whole lot more you can do. Most everything in NVML is wrapped and ready to go
# Ok(())
# }
```

NVML is intended to be a platform for building 3rd-party applications, and is
also the underlying library for NVIDIA's nvidia-smi tool.

## Usage

`nvml-wrapper` builds on top of generated bindings for NVML that make use of the
[`libloading`][libloading] crate. This means the NVML library gets loaded upon
calling `Nvml::init` and can return an error if NVML isn't present, making it
possible to drop NVIDIA-related features in your code at runtime on systems that
don't have relevant hardware.

Successful execution of `Nvml::init` means:

* The NVML library was present on the system and able to be opened
* The function symbol to initialize NVML was loaded and called successfully
* An attempt has been made to load all other NVML function symbols

Every function you call thereafter will individually return an error if it couldn't
be loaded from the NVML library during the `Nvml::init` call.

Note that it's not advised to repeatedly call `Nvml::init` as the constructor
has to perform all the work of loading the function symbols from the library
each time it gets called. Instead, call `Nvml::init` once and store the resulting
`Nvml` instance somewhere to be accessed throughout the lifetime of your program
(perhaps in a [`once_cell`][once_cell]).

## NVML Support

This wrapper is being developed against and currently supports NVML version
11. Each new version of NVML is guaranteed to be backwards-compatible according
to NVIDIA, so this wrapper should continue to work without issue regardless of
NVML version bumps.

## MSRV

The Minimum Supported Rust Version is currently 1.51.0. I will not go out of my
way to avoid bumping this.

## Cargo Features

The `serde` feature can be toggled on in order to `#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]`
for every NVML data structure.

/**
The main struct that this library revolves around.

According to NVIDIA's documentation, "It is the user's responsibility to call `nvmlInit()`
before calling any other methods, and `nvmlShutdown()` once NVML is no longer being used."
This struct is used to enforce those rules.

Also according to NVIDIA's documentation, "NVML is thread-safe so it is safe to make
simultaneous NVML calls from multiple threads." In the Rust world, this translates to `NVML`
being `Send` + `Sync`. You can `.clone()` an `Arc` wrapped `NVML` and enjoy using it on any thread.

NOTE: If you care about possible errors returned from `nvmlShutdown()`, use the `.shutdown()`
method on this struct. **The `Drop` implementation ignores errors.**

When reading documentation on this struct and its members, remember that a lot of it,
especially in regards to errors returned, is copied from NVIDIA's docs. While they can be found
online [here](http://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/nvml-api/index.html), the hosted docs sometimes outdated
and may not accurately reflect the version of NVML that this library is written for; beware. You
should ideally read the doc comments on an up-to-date NVML API header. Such a header can be
downloaded as part of the [CUDA toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).

    Handles NVML initialization and must be called before doing anything else.

    While it is possible to initialize `NVML` multiple times (NVIDIA's docs state
    that reference counting is used internally), you should strive to initialize
    `NVML` once at the start of your program's execution; the constructors handle
    dynamically loading function symbols from the `NVML` lib and are therefore
    somewhat expensive.

    Note that this will initialize NVML but not any GPUs. This means that NVML can
    communicate with a GPU even when other GPUs in a system are bad or unstable.

    By default, initialization looks for "libnvidia-ml.so" on linux and "nvml.dll"
    on Windows. These default names should work for default installs on those
    platforms; if further specification is required, use `Nvml::builder`.
